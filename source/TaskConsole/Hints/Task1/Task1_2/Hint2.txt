#Hint 2
Looping over the product bogus data, you will need to map the product category (and set it as its primary category).

if (categoryIdentifiers.TryGetValue(product.ErpType, out var categoryId))
{
    //Using the ERP type value on the product, a category with a matching alias was found
    productToCreate.PrimaryCategoryId = categoryId;
    productToCreate.CategoryIds = new List<int> { categoryId };
}

You will need to specify the product structure uid. Also set the determined variation definition
productToCreate.ProductStructureUid = clothingProductStructure.Uid;

Lastly you should map the actual values of the product. For this you should use the existing Mapper class
Look at the mapper from the previous task. This might help you on how to map localized data.
