#Hint 1
In our mapping we need to be able to classify products in their correct category. For this we will utilize the "Identifiers" on categories.
Identifers are attribute valeus which are configured to be unqiue for entities in PIM.
    var categoryIdentifiers = _apiClient.Catalogues.GetInternalIdMap("Alias");


A product in PIM always has a product structure, which defines the model of the product.
    var clothingProductStructure = _apiClient.ProductStructures.GetProductStructures().Single(x => x.Alias == "Clothing");

When a product structure is defined to also have variants, we should specify which type of variation definition the product is using.
The variation definitions are defined on the product structure. 
    var variationDefinition = clothingProductStructure.VariationDefinitions.Single(v => v.Name == "Clothing");
