Hint 1
Look at the previous task (3.3). You should be fetching the global list values in the same way.

//Find the currencies global list
var currencyGlobalList = _apiClient.GlobalLists.GetGlobalList("Currency");

//Fetch currencies which contains the conversionrates
var currencies = _apiClient.GlobalLists.GetGlobalListValues<CurrencyGlobalListModel>(currencyGlobalList.Uid);

When looping over each variant, you should check if the variant has a CostPrice.
If it does, you should loop over each currency from the global list, and calculate the price for each currency.
